# The Day My Code Wrote Itself

Once upon a time in a land far, far away, there was a developer who was too lazy to write code. So, they decided to let their code write itself.

## The Setup

It all started with a simple `console.log("Hello, World!");`. Little did they know, this line of code had a mind of its own.

### The Unexpected

One day, the developer woke up to find their computer screen filled with lines of code they had never written. It was as if their code had come to life!

```javascript
function surprise() {
    console.log("I wrote myself!");
}
surprise();
```

## The Aftermath

The developer was both amazed and terrified. They decided to let the code do its thing, and soon enough, their entire project was completed without them lifting a finger.

- No more debugging
- No more late nights
- No more coffee spills on the keyboard

### Lessons Learned

In the end, the developer learned a valuable lesson: sometimes, it's best to let the code take the wheel.

> "To code or not to code, that is the question." - Shakespeare, probably

## Conclusion

And so, the developer lived happily ever after, letting their code write itself while they enjoyed a nice cup of tea.
